# BioLoop-Agents
A network of AI-driven agents (“BioLoop Agents”) that continuously monitor, optimize, and close the loop on two of a hospital’s biggest challenges: 1. Clinical workflow inefficiencies 2. Environmental impact (waste, energy, supplies) These agents collaborate—like a digital sustainability task force—to make hospitals smarter, greener, and safer.
